### Hi! Welcome to my GitHub. 

This GitHub is currently under construction. I'm working on a personal website that will showcase all of my work. 

This personal website will include a password-protected section for recruiters/future employers to look at code that is restricted due to academic honesty contracts I signed. I can not upload much of the code I have worked on directly to GitHub due to these contracts which require me to ensure that any code I wrote related to coursework is not publicly accessible to students who may use it to cheat on their assignments. 

My personal projects will be directly available on GitHub.

Stay tuned!
