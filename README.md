### Hi! Welcome to my GitHub. 

This GitHub is currently under construction. I'm working on a personal website that will showcase all of my work, as well as a password-protected section for recruiters/future employers to look at code I wrote related to coursework. My personal projects will be directly available on GitHub. 

I can not upload much of the code I have worked on directly to GitHub due to a number of academic honesty contracts I signed. These coursework academic honesty contracts which required me to ensure any code I wrote related to class is not publicly accessible to students who may use it to cheat on their assignments.  

Stay tuned!
